        <p>Hey!<br>
            Fency meet you here!
            Well, I am accomplishing my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science & Engineering from very well known Daffodil International University. I was always a moderate student. Maybe, I haven't had a good result but I was always thirsty for knowledge and gathering new experiences. I'm trying to achieve a decent overall result. I was always passionate about hacking, cyber security etc. Since my dream is to become a Cyber protector or Cyber security engineer.Hence, I am learning various programming languages and about computer network to cherish my dream. I am really interested in International affairs that I have been passionate about because I do model UN. I am also involved in different volunteering organisations like Rover Scout. <mark>WISH ME GOOD LUCK........!</mark></p>
